User contributed examples of the library being used in action:
* [Induction Heads Phase Change Replication](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ckkissane/induction-heads-transformer-lens/blob/main/Induction_Heads_Phase_Change.ipynb): A partial replication of [In-Context Learning and Induction Heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) from Connor Kissane
* [Decision Transformer Interpretability](https://github.com/jbloomAus/DecisionTransformerInterpretability): A set of scripts for training decision transformers which uses transformer lens to view intermediate activations, perform attribution and ablations. A write up of the initial work can be found [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bBuBDJBYHt39Q5zZy/decision-transformer-interpretability).
